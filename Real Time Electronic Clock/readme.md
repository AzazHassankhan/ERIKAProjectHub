This repository contains the implementation of a real-time electronic clock developed using Erika OS and Run-Time Environment (RTE). The project demonstrates the integration of real-time operating system capabilities to accurately maintain and display time while efficiently managing system resources.

## Features

- **Real-Time Clock**: Utilizes Erika OS to ensure precise timekeeping and synchronization.
- **Task Scheduling**: Implements efficient task scheduling for updating time, handling user inputs, and displaying current time.
- **Modular Design**: Follows a modular architecture to facilitate ease of development, testing, and maintenance.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for setting and displaying the time using LCD displays.
- **Alarms and Timers**: Includes features for setting alarms and timers with reliable real-time accuracy.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Optimized for low power consumption to ensure prolonged operation in embedded environments.
- **Robust Performance**: Ensures consistent and reliable performance with real-time responsiveness.
