This repository contains the design and implementation of a simple electric car architecture developed using Erika OS and RTE (Run-Time Environment). This project showcases the integration of various components and subsystems to build a functional electric car model, emphasizing real-time operating system capabilities and efficient resource management.

## Features

- **Real-Time Operating System**: Utilizes Erika OS, a lightweight and open-source RTOS, to manage tasks and ensure timely execution of critical functions.
- **Run-Time Environment**: Implements RTE for seamless integration and communication between software components.
- **Modular Design**: Follows a modular architecture to facilitate ease of development, testing, and maintenance.
- **Radar-Based Detection System**: Includes a radar-based object detection system with advanced signal processing and CFAR algorithms for enhanced accuracy.
- **Safety Features**: Implements engine blocking detection and other safety mechanisms to ensure reliable operation.
